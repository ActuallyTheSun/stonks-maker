# stonks-maker
 
stonks maker is a discord bot i made for fun in discord.js. I gave up on hosting the bot and made this repo because i dont wanna give discord all that info for verification. So, now this exists. Setting up should be a simple `npm install` and adding the token. if there are any bugs, open an issue. 
The bot uses fs for the currency. Oh yeah, this is a currency bot. A meme one, therefore the main currency is Dogecoin. You can invest it, for profits. Or it can crash and you lose money. with a bit of extra stuff like a daily command and shop, this is a basic currency bot.
